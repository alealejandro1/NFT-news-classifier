In this notebook, I'll be working with NewsAPI and Multinomial Bayesian classifier from sci-kit learn to investigate
how can we build a classifier for NFT news, trying to understand if we can sense how NFTs are perceived by the media. Namely, trying to answer "ARE NFTs bad?". As expected, the answer is not clear. Labeled Data is likely not sufficient and more importantly, has been labeled by me manually.
As this topic is open to interpretation and subject to bias, the challenge does not lie in the actual model, but actually on creating robust criterias for labeling the rows ("Good"/"Bad").

You can try it out, but you might need a NEWS API token, which is free to obtain. Mine is not included here.
