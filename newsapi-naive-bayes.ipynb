    "\n",
    "## Considerations\n",
    "* I'm using the News API (https://newsapi.org/)\n",
    "* You'll need an API key to use the API, mine is not included in the repo\n",
    "* I'll keep a dataframe with some data harvested from the API. Good to not ask too much from API.\n",

    "Some considerations from the API documentation:\n",
    "* Free accounts can only retrieve 100 articles, which means up to 5 pages of 20 articles per page.\n",
    "* Free accounts can only look back 30 days in time\n",
    "* Free accounts can only run 120 queries every 24 hs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach:\n",
    "* Query a sliding window of time, until a certain max_date. News after max_date will be used for testing\n",
    "* Make sliding window small, so is possible to retrieve as many articles as possible within the constraints of the developer license\n",
    "* Making sliding window NOT that small, because we only have 120 queries per day. Getting 20 articles per query, it means we can obtain a maximum of ~2000 articles at best per day."
